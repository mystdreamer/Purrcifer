## Enemies
Floating skull: 
A floating human skull, bobs around the room and rushes the player to headbutt the player until either one dies. 
Can be pushed away when hit by the player.

Leach: 
An oversized bloodsucking leech, wriggles towards the player until it latches on, 
draining the player’s health little by little until they’ve drained the player of all their blood.

Shadow Person: 
A shadowy figure as dark as the night, nearly invisible in the dark. 
Relentlessly attacks the player, punching until either the player or the figure isn’t moving.

Blob: 
A weird, colorful blob of unknown origins. 
The blob slowly oozes around the room, until coming into contact with the player, 
where it attempts to drown the player in its slime.

Hairball: 
A weird, moving mass of hair and … something else, rolls around the room attempting to roll into the player.
